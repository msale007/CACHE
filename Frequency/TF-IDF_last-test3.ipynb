For business executives and boards of directors to assess the materiality of events that need to be disclosed, cyber loss exposure needs to be measured in financial terms, dollars and cents.Implementing the FAIR standard not only provides a transparent approach to estimating cyber risk financially, but also complements major cybersecurity frameworks – including NIST CSF – that only provide a qualitative view of the state of security implementations.Tools now based on FAIR allow organizations to assess and report on cyber risk at scale.Industry BenchmarkingTo assess cyber risk posture in context, many boards like to benchmark cyber loss exposure against industry peers. This helps assess whether their company is more effective in dealing with cyber threats than peers and determine if more cybersecurity investments are needed.Organizations can use cyber risk benchmark solutions based on empirical data that show average loss exposure experienced by companies in similar sectors and similar size, and compare it against their own risk assessments.Quantitative cyber risk management programs based on standards such as FAIR also allow organizations to demonstrate cybersecurity investment adequacy, another SEC guidance element. This can be accomplished by analyzing and reporting on cybersecurity initiative effectiveness in driving cyber risk to acceptable levels.Ultimately, all organizations must maintain vigilance when it comes to cybersecurity.
