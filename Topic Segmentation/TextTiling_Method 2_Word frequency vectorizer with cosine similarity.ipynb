    "Text segmentation, also known as text splitting, is the process of dividing a continuous text into segments or sections based on some patterns or criteria. These segments are intended to represent different topics or themes present in the text. Text segmentation is a common technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval tasks.\n",

    "There are several methods and algorithms for text segmentation. One such method is called TextTiling. TextTiling is a technique developed by Marti Hearst in 1994. It is mainly used for segmenting longer texts, such as essays, articles, or documents. TextTiling relies on finding patterns in word frequencies and co-occurrences to identify boundaries between different topics.\n",
