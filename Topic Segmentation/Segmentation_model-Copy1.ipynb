      "Santa Barbara -- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . \n",
      "Another speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more '' . \n",
      "He urged support for President Kennedy 's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n",
      "' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n",
      "`` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . \n",
      "==========\n",
      "Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . \n",
      "When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle 's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . \n",
      "But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . \n",
      "==========\n",
      "Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . \n",
      "Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . \n",
      "Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . \n",
      "Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . \n",
      "Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . \n",
      "Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . \n",

      "Introduction . \n",
      "In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \n",
      "These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \n",
      "Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \n",
      "No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n",
      "1 . \n",
      "Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Afj and Afj , and let \\*\\* zg be a Afj curve of order K on Q . \n",

      "A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \n",
      "But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \n",
      "The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \n",
      "By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \n",
      "This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \n",
      "Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . \n",
      "The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . \n",
      "The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . \n",
      "The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . \n",
      "==========\n",
      "Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . \n",
      "With respect to this view , two points are worth making . \n",
      "First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . \n",
      "It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . \n",

      "Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . \n",
      "Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . \n",
      "Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . \n",
      "Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . \n",
      "A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . \n",

      "Greer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . \n",
      "As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . \n",
      "She will receive the 1961 `` Oscar '' at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . \n",
      "The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women 's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men 's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . \n",
      "The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . \n",
      "The attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . \n",
      "Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It 's unlike me '' . \n",

      "The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . \n",
      "The 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . \n",
      "Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . \n",

      "artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . \n",
      "To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . \n",
      "At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . \n",
      "Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . \n",
      "And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . \n",
      "The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds . \n",
      "Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . \n",
      "In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . \n",
      "The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated . \n",
